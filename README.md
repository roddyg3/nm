# PlayingCardsClient
Node.js console application that creates a deck of cards, shuffles them, and distributes them to the user-specified number of players.

Card shuffling is performed by simulating the ripple shuffle method, following the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%E2%80%93Shannon%E2%80%93Reeds_model).

Unit tests use Jest.

This is my first Node.js application. Please enjoy! :)
