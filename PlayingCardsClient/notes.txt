unit tests
- deck is created with complete set of cards
- shuffling?

requirements
- handle number of users is < 1
- handle number of users is > 52
- deal to players until all cards run out
- show players hands
- shuffle 7 times

nice to have
- different shuffle options user can select
- GUI, or at least ASCII representation of cards / players
- allow user to input number of shuffles?
- deal equally to players option (number of users receive equal amount of
  cards, remainder is kept in deck)
- RobotJS to unit test user input

Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model
An alternative description can be based on a property of the model,
that it generates a permutation of the initial deck in which each card
is equally likely to have come from the first or the second packet.
To generate a random permutation according to this model, begin by flipping
a fair coin n times, to determine for each position of the shuffled deck
whether it comes from the first packet or the second packet. Then split
into two packets whose sizes are the number of tails and the number of heads
flipped, and use the same coin flip sequence to determine from which packet
to pull each card of the shuffled deck.
